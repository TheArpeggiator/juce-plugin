juce-plugin
=========

Use of the JUCE framework to create a crappy plugin.

Disclaimer
---------

This plugin was intended for all purposes to sound beautiful, melodic and sublime. And it does! (The faust code of this plugin works perfectly!); if run on and debugged properly on macintosh based computer. But I do not have a mac and so had to build, test and run this crappy plugin on my linux based computer.

(Heads up to all the plugin developers out there, never use linux+JUCE+faust for audio development purposes!)

Also please do not use this plugin. It is bad, very bad. If you can fix it, please do so on a Mac because apparently audio works as it should on a mac.

Watch it here in all of its glory! : https://youtu.be/Fuhjz0cDSZY
